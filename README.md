# Library
Your personal library, where you can add books with the information of the Title, the Author, the Page-Count and if you have read the book or not!

# Description
This was an exercise following the "The Odin Project"-Path in becoming a web developer. 
Check this exercise out: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

In this exercise, I've practiced my skills using Objects & DOM Manipulation in JavaScript. It was also a good exercise using nested Flexbox and Grid. With those tools, I created a mostly responsive App. The more books you add, the more columns will be created, limited to 3 columns (after that, it will wrap onto the next row).

I learned a lot about OOP and gained confidence in using JavaScript combined with HTML & CSS. I've had some troubles in the DOM-Manipulation, but as soon as I had this figured out, this exercise was pretty straight forward to me.

# How-To
Just fill in the form on the right side of the screen and click the "Submit"-Button, to add a new book to your library on the left side of the screen. There, you can see the contents you filled in, and you can delete it from there via the "Remove Book"-Button.


Lastly, thank you for reviewing my Code and/or my Application!
